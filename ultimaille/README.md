# UltiMaille: the ultimate mesh processing library
This library does **not** contain any ready-to-execute remeshing algorithms. It simply provides a friendly way to manipulate a surface/volume mesh, it is meant to be used by your geometry processing software.

There are lots of mesh processing libraries in the wild, excellent specimens are:
* [geogram](http://alice.loria.fr/software/geogram/doc/html/index.html)
* [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl)
* [pmp](http://www.pmp-library.org/)
* [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/)

I am, however, not satisfied with either of those. At the moment of this writing, Geogram, for instance, has 847 thousands (sic!) of lines of code. I strive to make a library under 10K loc able to do common mesh handling tasks for surfaces and volumes. Another reason to create yet-another-mesh-library is that I like explicit types and avoid `auto` as long as it reasonable. In practice it means that I cannot use libigl for the simple reason that I do not know what this data represents:
```C++
Eigen::MatrixXd V;
Eigen::MatrixXi F;
```
Is it a polygonal surface or a tetrahedral mesh? If surface, is it triangulated or is it a generic polygonal mesh? I simply can not tell... Thus, ultimaille provides several classes that allow to represent meshes:
```
PointSet
PolyLine
Triangles, Quads, Polygons
Tetrahedra, Hexahedra, Wedges, Pyramids
```

You can not mix tetrahedra and hexahedra in a single mesh, I believe that it is confusing to do otherwise. If you need a mixed mesh, create a separate mesh for each cell type: these classes allow to share a common set of vertices via a `std::shared_ptr`.

# Common principles
* This library is meant to have a *reasonable* performance. It means that I strive to make it as rapid as possible as long as it does not deteriorate the readability of the source code.
* All the library is built around STL containers (mainly `std::vector<int>`), normally it will have no `malloc/free/new/delete` instructions.
* Despite that, there will be no `size_t` and `iterator::` in the code. An `int` is an `int`. Period.
* There will be as little templates as it is reasonable, the default data types are `int` and `double`.

# Compile and run unit tests:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ssloy/ultimaille.git &&
cd ultimaille &&
mkdir build &&
cd build &&
cmake -DUM_UNIT_TESTS:BOOL=ON .. &&
make -j &&
cd tests && 
ctest
```
